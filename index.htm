        <h2>What is computer security?</h2>
        <p>Computer security is more important now than ever before. This is due to the fact that weâ€™ve come to rely more and more on the internet and computers (PCs, laptops, smart devices such as smartphones, etc.) over the years, and as technology progresses, so does the need to secure it.</p>  
        <p>The purpose of computer security is to protect computers from damage or theft to their hardware and software. Some other names for computer security include: cyber security, and IT security.</p>
        <h3>Software Protection</h3>
        <p>The most common form of computer security is antivirus software, which controls access to a computers software and ensures there are no malicious attempts at compromising the computer via a network or the internet. Windows Defender is the default antivirus software that comes with Windows 10.</p>
        <p>Other examples of antivirus software include:</p>
        <li>Norton Antivirus</li>
        <li>Avg Antivirus</li>
        <li>Avast Antivirus</li>
        <h3>Hardware Protection</h3>
        <p>As previously mentioned: computer security also handles the protection of computer <strong>hardware</strong>, not only the software. Hardware protection comes in the form of the physical safekeeping of servers and other computers. This can be achieved through hiring security to guard hardware and keeping hardware in locked rooms and containers.</p>
